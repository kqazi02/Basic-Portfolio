				<section id="intro">
					<p>I was born in Pakistan, and immigrated to the United States in 2005, while a sophomore in High School. Even though I was not born and raised here, I am a true Texan, with special place for steak and barbecue, in my heart.
					</p>
					<p>I attended the University of Texas at Austin, where I got my Bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering. After college, I started working as an applications engineer for production equipment manufacturing company, which is a position I still hold.
					</p><br>
					<p>I am a man of many interests, and firmly believe in continous improvement of self. While many choose to master one thing, I believe in learning something about everything. This was one of many reasons for choosing mechanical engineering as my major in college.
					</p><br>
					<p>Currently, I am enrolled in web developer bootcamp, through UT Austin Center for Professional Education, where I am learning ins and outs of full stack web-app development. Upon graduation, I plan on using my newly learned skills, along with my experience in the oil and gas industry, to create softwares solutions for the oil and gas industry.
